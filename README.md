## RPG characters

This is console application in C# - kind of console RPG.

Note: Unfortunately, I got stuck at certain points while working on this assignment, and therefore needed more time to figure things out. Due to time constraints, I was not able to include all the listed features in the assignment.

The application allows you to create different types of characters. For example Mage, Ranger, Rogue or Warrior.
Your character can equip various armor and weapons. All character types have their own attributes, as well as allowed types of armor and weapons.
You can also give your character a name and level it up.
Other options are to check your character's stats or check the character's gear.
